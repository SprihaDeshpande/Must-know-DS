# Must-know-Sorting-Algorithms
Taking a look at most important sorting algorithms

### 1. Merge Sort:

It divides input array in two halves, calls itself for the two halves and then merges the two sorted halves. We look at the helper function to return a final result.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

### 2. Quicksort:
QuickSort is a Divide and Conquer algorithm. It picks an element as pivot and partitions the given array around the picked pivot. 

We pick the last element as pivot.

Time Complexity: O(nlogn)

By far the above two sorting algorithms are best used in industry for their complexity.

# Must-know-DS Implementation

Here we implement 
1. queue using stacks
2. stacks using queue

All in O(N) operation and these are important questionarre.
